\section{Semimartingales and It\^{o} processes}

This chapter could have been placed much earlier in these notes (after Chapter 2, for instance). It appears in its current position simply because we wished to give a rather direct approach to stochastic calculus, with minimal development of the general theory of martingales. However, it would be foolish to omit this material, since martingales are such a fundamental part of stochastic analysis. Despite this, the impatient reader could skip ahead to the next chapter on first reading without spoiling the overall story.

We continue with the conventions and notations of the previous two chapters. In particular, we are always working on a filtered probability space, and for convenience, we will assume that the filtration $(\mathcal{F})_{t\ge 0}$ satisfies the usual conditions. In addition, we consider exclusively processes with continuous sample paths.
